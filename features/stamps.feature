Feature: Stamps and Badges
    As a user,
    So that I can see a preview of my collected badges and stamps,
    I want to see a row of my most recent badges and stamps in my profile.

Background: users in database
Given the following users exist:
    | email             | password_digest | name  |
    | abc@gmail.com     | abc123          | Abet  |
    | xyz@gmail.com     | asj438f84       | Kayla |
    | and123@yahoo.com  | password01      | Syd   |
    | pete@gmail.com    | idk1234         | Pete  |
And the following art pieces exist:
    | name       | address   |
    | Piece A    | foobar    |
    | Piece B    | foobar    |
    | Piece C    | foobar    |
    | Piece D    | foobar    |
